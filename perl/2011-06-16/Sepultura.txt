1. Refuse/Resist

Intro Zyon's heartbeat in utero

Chaos A.D.
Tanks on the streets
Confronting police
Bleeding the Plebs
Raging crowd
Burning cars
Bloodshed starts
Who'll be alive?!

Chaos A.D.
Army in siege
Total alarm
I'm sick of this
Inside the state
War is created
No man's land
What is this shit?!

Refuse/Resist
Refuse

Chaos A.D.
Disorder unleashed
Starting to burn
Starting to lynch
Silence means death
Stand on your feet
Inner fear
Your worst enemy

Refuse/Resist
Refuse/Resist


2. Territory

Unknown man
Speaks to the world
Sucking your trust
A trap in every world

War for territory
War for territory

Choice control
Behind propaganda
Poor information
To manage your anger

War for territory
War for territory

Dictators' speech
Blasting off your life
Rule to kill the urge
Dumb assholes' speech

Years of fighting
Teaching my son
To believe in that man
Racist human being
Racist ground will live
Shame and regret
Of the pride
You've once possessed

War for territory
War for territory


3. Slave New World

Face - The enemy
Stare - Inside you
Control - Your thoughts
Destroy - Destroy 'em all

You censor what we breathe
Prejudice with no belief
Senseless violence all around
Who is it, that keeps us down

Once all free tribes
Chained down led lives
Blood boils inside me
We're not slaves, we're free

Face - The enemy
Stare - Inside you
Control - Your thoughts
Destroy - Destroy 'em all


4. Amen

Forgive me father
Forgive me God
I know I've sinned
With no remorse
Apocalyptic visions
Went through my head Here today

Gone tomorrow
It's all insane
I'm feeling sick
I'm feeling numb
The storm will come
In the name of God I'm the chosen one

Terror raids the land
To ashes we'll be sent
In the name of God Lives cast away

Martyrdom of myself
Armageddon comes
In the name of God Not one more dead

Fire blasting, cutting edge
Children burn in flames
In the name of God We're going insane

Let us die
You don't realize
This is the time
God's sacrifice

Leaving behind
Lesson in hate
In the name of God We're all dead
Burn!


5. Kaiowas

[This song is inspired by a Brasilian Indian tribe called "Kaiowas", who live]
[in the rain forest. They committed mass suicide as a protest against the]
[government, who was trying to take away their land and beliefs.]


6. Propaganda

Why don't you get a life and grow up
Why don't you realize that you're fucked up
Why criticize what you don't understand
Why change my words, you're so afraid

You think you have the right to
put me down
Propaganda hides your scum
Face to face you don't have a word to say
You got in my way, now you'll have to pay

Don't, don't believe what you
see
Don't, don't believe what you read
No!!!

I know my ways, I'm here to stay
I didn't start all this yesterday
I'll prove you wrong all the way
Life teaches me you're always alone

Don't, don't believe what you
see
Don't, don't believe what read
No!!!


7. Biotech Is Godzilla

Rio Summit, '92
Street people kidnapped
Hid from view
"To save the earth"
Our rulers met
Some had other
Secret plans

No... No... No... No...

Biotech
Biotech
Biotech
Say what?

Strip-mine the Amazon
Of cells of life itself
Gold rush for genes is on
Natives get nothing

Biotech
Biotech
Biotech
Is Godzilla

Mutations cooked in labs
Money-mad experiments
New food + medicine?
New germs + accidents!
Like Cubatao
"World's most polluted town"
Air melts your face
Deformed children all around
Bio-technology
Ain't what's so bad
Like all technology
It's in the wrong hands

Cut-throat corporations
Don't give a damn
When lots of people die
From what they've made

Biotech
Biotech
Biotech
Is A.I.D.S.?

Stop!!!


8. Nomad

Travelling through the time
Moving slowly in the sand
Knowledge is the weapon
Against the hunger in the land

Solitude met herself
Lessons from the primal step
Memories from an ending life
Liars can't stop the tribes

Nomad, Nomad, Nomad, Nomad

Brother is the son of rape
The blood that once unites
Wanna choose the way they die
Look inside their minds

(echoes in the)
Actual tribe no longer sounds
The ancient teaching failed
Movement of my culture
My beliefs have no more tales

Who are you to criticize
To judge and burn the tribes
The world will be extinct
And your flesh will rot with mine

Nomad, Nomad, Nomad, Nomad


9. We Who Are Not As Others

We who are not as others
We who are not as others
We who are not as others
We who are not as others

We who are not as others
We who are not as others
We who are not as others


10. Manifest

Friday, October 2nd, 1992
Chaos has descended in "Carandiru", the biggest penitentiry complex in South
America
Over a hundred inmates dead and hundreds injured on the massacre
The police arrived with helicopters and over two hundred armed forces

They took the jailblock called "Pavilhao Nove" and opened fire on the inmates
in a holocaust, method of annihilation. The government of the city of Sao
Paulo cannot control the brutality of its police

Holocaust, Body piles
Confrontation, Mutilation
Discipline, Ignorance
Conflagration, Torture

Over eighty percent of the inmates were not sentenced yet. The bodies were
filled with bullets and bites from the police dogs
The police try to hide the massacre saying there were only eight deaths
The violence of Brasilian cops is very well known outside of Brasil. This
kind of extermination is a method that they use to get rid of the
overpopulation in the jails
The violence of the cops left the whole pavillion destroyed after the
rebellion
"Pavilhao Nove" (Pavilhao 9)


11. The Hunt

[New Model Army cover]

We Went Into Town On The Tuesday Night
Searching All The Places That You Hang About
We're Looking For You
In The Back Street Cellar Dive Drinking Clubs
In The Discotheques And The Gaming Pubs
We're Looking For You
You Will Pay The Price For My Own Sweet Brother
And What He Has Become
And A Hundred Other Boys And Girls
And All That You Have Done

We Picked Up The Trail At The Seven Crowns
One Of Your Cronies - He Was Doing Your Rounds
We Followed Him
Just A Silhouette Figure Up Market Pass
Where The Headlamps Shine On The Broken Glass
We Followed Him
Over The Bridge By The Old Canal
Where The Shadows Dance On The Lighted Wall
He Stopped To Light Up A Cigarette
And We Dived Into A Doorway

No Police, No Summons, No Courts Of Law
No Proper Procedure, No Rules Of War
No Mitigating Circumstance
No Lawyers Fees, No Second Chance

There Are Lasses Getting Trouble On Their Own Home Beat
There Are Old Folk Battered In The Open Street
In This City Of Ours
There Are Eyes That See But Say Nothing At All
There Are Ears That Hear But They Don't Recall
In This City Of Ours
So We Followed Your Man Back To Your Front Door
And We're Waiting For You Outside
'cos Not Everybody Here Is Scared Of You
Not Everybody Passes On The Other Side

No Police, No Summons, No Courts Of Law...

And We Could Spent Our Whole Lives Waiting
For Some Thunderbolt To Come
And We Could Spent Our Whole Lives Waiting
For Some Justice To Be Done
Unless We Make Our Own

No Police, No Summons, No Courts Of Law...


12. Clenched Fist

Pain, makes me stronger
Everyday
Life is chaos
You gotta deal with it

Expressing my agression
Through confusion
Face reality
Nothing is like it used to be

Don't tell me I don't know
You don't live in my war
Revolt and anger
I won't take it anymore

Don't get me wrong
You don't know where I'm from
Don't get me wrong
You don't know where I've been
Don't get me wrong
It's been a painful way
Don't get me wrong
You wouldn't understand
